There are 2 files for every class: One is the .cpp file and the other is the .h file.

- .h file contains the declration of the classes and its members
- cpp file contains the implementation and definition of the methods of the class.

There is an Account class havong account_no, name and balance as its data members.
It is also having class AccountManager1 as its friend function.
The Account.cpp file contains the implementation of getter and setters of the Account class data members.

AccountManager1 and AccountManager2 class both contains same methods:
- FillAccountData -> For filling the account details. It takes Account object as argument
- DisplayAccountData -> Display the account details. It also takes Account object as an argument.

FillAccountData and DisplayAccountData of AccountManager1 is directly modifying and accessing the Account class private variables as it is a friend class of Account.
FillAccountData and DisplayAccountData of AccountManager2 is using getters and setters for modifying and accessing the Account class private variables.


AccountManager1 is not able to add ICI prefix as it is not using the setter to modify the variable.
AccountManager2 is getting the "ICI" prefix due to the use of setter.

AccountManager1 is not able to add compund interest while setting the balance as it is directly setting the value of the data members.
whereas AccountManager2 is using setter to set the value so compund interest is added in the account balance.
